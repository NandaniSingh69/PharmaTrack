3. Safety & interaction awareness
You already import sideEffects and drugInteractions:

On the alternatives detail page, show:

Key side effects (first 3–5 in a bullet list).

Basic interaction warning if drugInteractions is not empty.

Add a simple rule‑based warning:

If a user selects two medicines (checkboxes), show “Possible interaction” if they share interaction entries.

Show a small disclaimer at the bottom (“Not a medical prescription, for educational/demo purposes only”).

Papers on medicine recommendation stress using interactions and contraindications to screen recommendations.

4. Blockchain-authenticated QR verification
Connect your new feature more tightly with the blockchain supply chain:

For each on‑chain product, generate a QR code that encodes:

barcodeId

Name + manufacturer

Create a /verify page:

User scans/enters barcode

Frontend:

Calls smart contract getSingleItem(barcodeId) to verify authenticity and history.

Then calls your MongoDB API to fetch composition + alternatives.

Show:

On‑chain timeline (manufacturer → distributor → retailer → customer).

“Verified on blockchain” badge vs “Not found / suspicious”.

This matches how blockchain is proposed to fight counterfeit drugs and provide end‑to‑end traceability.
​

5. Inventory/availability awareness
Even without a real pharmacy backend, you can simulate availability:

Add a stockStatus field in MongoDB (e.g., “In stock”, “Low stock”, “Out of stock”).

On alternatives page, show availability badge and allow filter:

“Hide out‑of‑stock”

For on‑chain products, you already have quantity; you can:

Decrease quantity when sellItem is called.

Mark “Low stock” when quantity is below threshold.

Better inventory visibility and real‑time tracking is a key benefit of blockchain pharma supply chains.
​

6. Small but impactful polish
A few extra touches that will impress in a portfolio/demo:

Saved medicines / bookmarks: Allow a user (by wallet address) to save a medicine or alternative list in localStorage or a lightweight DB.

Export comparison as PDF: Generate a simple PDF of the comparison table for printing or sharing.

Search history & popular searches: Track which medicines are searched most and show “Trending medicines”.

All of these are realistic features that connect well to real products like generic‑comparison portals and blockchain traceability dashboards.
​

If you tell which direction you like more—price focus, safety/clinical info, or blockchain/traceability—the next step can be a concrete mini‑roadmap with exact fields, APIs, and UI changes.
